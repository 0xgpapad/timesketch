# Upload Data to Timesketch

There are several different ways to upload data to Timesketch. This document
attempts to explore them all.

These are the different ways to upload data:

1. Directly using the REST API.
2. Using the API client, or the importer library.
3. Using the web UI.
4. Using the importer CLI tool.
5. SCP or transferring a file to an upload folder on the Timesketch server.

Let's explore each of these ways a bit further.
